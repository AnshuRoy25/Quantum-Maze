Level 1 : Superposition

Quantum Superposition: Quantum Superposition is like flipping a coin and having it be both heads and tails at the same time—until you look at it. In the quantum world, tiny particles (like electrons or photons) don’t just exist in one state (like "left" or "right") but in multiple states simultaneously. Only when we measure them do they "choose" a definite state.

Rules: 
1. Every 10 seconds the last collapse of the electron(player) waveform, the superposition state will be achieved by the electron. 
2. If you press any key (W/A/S/D)(measure it)...the waveform will collapse and any one of the possible states will be achieves by the electron in the maze.
3. You Have to Reach the Green Block in order to complete the levels.

Level 2 : Entanglement

Quantum Entanglement: When two particles become entangled, their states are linked. If you measure one particle and find it in a certain state, the other particle instantly takes on a matching state, no matter how far apart they are. It's like a spooky, instant connection that Einstein called "spooky action at a distance".

Rules:
1. Initially, there are few red walls (in superposition state of there and not there) in the maze
2. when you press 'F' when you are adjacent to a Red block in superposition, the superposition state of that adjacent wall collapses along with that of its entangled pair.
3. Eg: If one door takes an open state(white) then its entangled pair will take the opposite state, i.e closed state(red)

Level 3 : Tunneling

Quantum Tunneling: Quantum Tunneling is like a ghost walking through a wall instead of bumping into it! In the normal world, if you throw a ball at a wall, it will bounce back. But in the quantum world, tiny particles (like electrons) can sometimes pass through barriers that they shouldn’t be able to cross—almost like teleporting through!

Rules:
1. If you want to tunnel through a specific wall, You have to press (W/A/S/D + SpaceBar) Key in order to tunnel in that particular direction.
2. Intially the tunnel probability for the electron is 20%. That is 20% percentage change of you to tunnel.
3. Also there is a Tunneling Cooldown, meaning is that you can only try tunneling every 10 seconds.
4. There are Yellow Energy Blocks in the maze. If you pass through them then your chance of tunneling will increase by 10%

Level 4 : Quantum Hunter

1. An Enemy which chase you using Tunneling and Superposition.
2. You have to avoid letting him catch You and reach the green block.

Level 5:

1. In this Final Level, Walls are in Quantum Superposition (there and not there) unless we press any key to measure it.
2. Each time we measure it, a new probable maze will form.
